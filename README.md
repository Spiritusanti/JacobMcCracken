# Personal website
built following Kevin Powell's Free Code Camp video course @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xkSvufmjEs

I chose to follow this template as I was interested in learning more about CSS and how to use it to flesh out the styling on a webpage beyond what I have done so far.

# customizations:
1. added SVG logos for technologies used in projects
2. reworked styling for services section to include transparent background to improve text readability
3. alter portfolio item img styling to include a responsive label for each project that dissapears on hover to allow for original animation

# future enhancements
1. add more interactive features
2.
