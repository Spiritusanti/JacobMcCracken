# Personal website
built following Kevin Powell's Free Code Camp video course @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xkSvufmjEs

I chose to follow this template as I was interedted in learning more about CSS and how to use it to flesh out the styling on a webpage beyond what I have done so far.

customizations TBD - will be adding completed projects and hosting on GH-pages
Will update once deployed.
